      The tutorial boss of the game, the Metal Gear RAY is an unmanned, AI-controlled bi-pedal machine. It reaches a height of about a 70ft and modified to be heavily armed with stealth cruise missles and a powerful plasma cannon.
      <br>
      Despite its large size and flashy appearance, the Metal Gear RAY fight is the easiest fight boss, natural for the tutorial boss. Due to it a one-time appearance, maching tutorial boss, there are few interesting details to divulge aside from military history and such.
      <br>
      As the tutorial boss, the Metal Gear RAY is the first instance of the <i>Rules of Nature</i> generic boss theme, which generally plays for similar machine, AI-controlled bosses.
